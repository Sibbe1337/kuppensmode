# Audit Reports & Evidence

Store all audit reports and supporting evidence in this directory.

## What to Include
- Periodic audit reports (monthly, quarterly, annual)
- Evidence snapshots (e.g., logs, policy documents, training records)
- Exported evidence packages for auditors
- Any correspondence or checklists related to audits

## Best Practices
- Name files with the report type and date (e.g., `soc2-audit-report-2024-Q2.pdf`).
- Update this directory after each audit or evidence collection cycle.
- Keep this directory organized and up to date for audit readiness.
